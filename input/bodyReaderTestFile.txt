# reformed file format: 
# Lines of comment start with '#' and are allowed at the beginning of the file and after just before the definition of epsilon and sigma
# Empty lines are not allowed.
# The first line not being a comment has to be one integer, indicating the number of bodies incomnig
#
# Bodies consists of 
# * xyz-coordinates (3 double values)
# * velocities (2 or 3 double values)
# * mass (1 double value)
# * shape (cuboid, sphere or particle)
# * dimensions (3 int values)
# * distance (1 double value)
# where the use of shape, dimensions and distance is optional. not using them will result in one particle being created.
# You cannot e.g. define the shape cuboid without defining its dimensions or distance
#
